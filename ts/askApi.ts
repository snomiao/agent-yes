 * different identity from the task's `owner` by construction, satisfying
 * independent verification) and advances the transition. This atomicity is
 * the closed loop's core property for those two kinds, and it is about the
 * TASK'S STORED STATE specifically: there is no intermediate state where the
 * block is cleared but the gate/transition hasn't happened, and no separate
 * step a human or orchestrator has to remember to run afterward. (Real-time
 * delivery of the answer to a currently-live agent is a SEPARATE, best-effort
 * concern handled by the caller — see `ts/serve.ts`'s `/api/asks/answer`
 * route — and deliberately not part of this guarantee: if that delivery
 * fails, the task's state is still correctly updated and durable here, and
 * the agent finds out on its own next normal check, e.g. `ay todo get` or a
 * reconcile pass, rather than through a guaranteed push.)
 *
 * Restricted to `human`/`decision` deliberately: this function opens its own
 * fresh `TodoStore` (via `openStore`), which has NO registered gates of its
 * own — `registerGate()` is an in-memory, per-process registration a
 * consuming project makes on ITS OWN store instance (e.g. Part B registering
 * `sym003-canary-green`), invisible to a store opened here. For `code`/
 * `doc`/`investigation` kinds, a `blocked-by-human` block can sit on a task
 * whose CURRENT state's gated edge is actually a registered, automated gate
 * in the real deployment (verifying->done via a CI/QA check) — blindly
 * checking `isRegisteredGate()` on a throwaway instance would ALWAYS see it
 * as unregistered and incorrectly let a human's mere acknowledgement drive
 * straight past an automated verification step. `human`/`decision` don't
 * have this ambiguity: their gated edges (`human-replied`, `human-decided`)
 * exist SPECIFICALLY to be satisfied by a human answering — there is no
 * automated-gate competition to accidentally bypass. For every other kind,
 * this function only clears the block; whatever actually owns that kind's
 * transition (an agent, `ay todo verify`, etc.) still drives it.
